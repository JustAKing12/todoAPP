## 📝 What did I learn with the project?
As i am recently learning javascript and react, with this project I have learned how to implement the MVC model to a react project, the use of components and the problems that can arise such as prop drilling.
I know it is little but for me it represents an achievement to be able to translate my ideas into a web application that helps people with a problem.

## 🚀 How can I run the project?
First of all copy the project with ```bash'https://github.com/JustAKing12/todoAPP.git'.```
Then you run ```bash 'npm install'``` to download its dependencies.
Finally you use ```bash'npm run dev'``` to run the project in development mode (so you can do the tests you want).
